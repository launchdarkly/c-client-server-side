# Change log

All notable changes to the LaunchDarkly C server-side SDK will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## [1.2.0] - 2020-01-22
### Added:
- Added support for utilizing external feature stores. See the new `launchdarkly/store.h` file for details on implementing a store. You can configure usage of a specific store with `LDConfigSetFeatureStoreBackend`.
- Added support for Redis as an external feature store. To build add `-D REDIS_STORE=ON` to your cmake build. This will require the hiredis library to be installed on your system.
- Added LaunchDarkly daemon mode configurable with `LDConfigSetUseLDD`.
- Added a code coverage reporting system. To build with code coverage add `-D COVERAGE=ON` to your cmake build. Run the tests, then build the `coverage` target. This will generate an HTML report.
### Fixed:
- The SDK now specifies a uniquely identifiable request header when sending events to LaunchDarkly to ensure that events are only processed once, even if the SDK sends them two times due to a failed initial attempt.
- Change how time is handled on OSX to support old OSX versions.
